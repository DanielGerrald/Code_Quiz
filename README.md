# Code_Quiz
## Description
For this project I created a times quiz with 5 questions that had 4 possible answers each. once one of the 4 choices was chosen the next question would replace the original along with all 4 choices being replaced to fit the new question. If an incorrect choice was made then the time would be subtracted 10 seconds. once all questions are answered the timer will be stopped and the user will be prompted to enter their initials to be applied to the high score page along with there time.
The person with the higher time will be sorted to first place.
